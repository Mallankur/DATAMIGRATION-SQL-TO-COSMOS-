                                                     Azure Data Factory Deployment
 	Creating an Azure Data Factory Resource in azure Portal 

 
Fig 2.0 Deployment of Azure Factory in Azure Cloude 
Our journey began with the creation of an Azure Data Factory resource in the Azure Portal. This resource acts as the central hub for orchestrating our data integration processes. For this We follow Several Steps .
	Azure Portal Access: We accessed the Azure Portal using our organization's Azure account credentials.
	Resource Creation: Within the Azure Portal, we navigated to the "Create a resource" panel. Here, we selected the "Data + Analytics" category and chose "Data Factory" from the list of available services.
	Configuration: We provided essential configuration details for our Data Factory resource, 
	Review and Create: After reviewing our configuration settings to confirm accuracy, we initiated the creation process. Azure then provisioned our Data Factory resource.
	Deployment Completion: Once the deployment process was complete, our Azure Data Factory resource was ready to use. 

After Deployment you will reach a new page Azure Data Studio where you can launch your studio in the 
 	Azure Data Studio's
Home: The Home section is your landing page in Azure Data Studio. It provides quick access to recent projects and enables you to create new projects. It's a central hub for managing your data-related tasks.

	In this section we have mange all our Deployment related to the Azure Data Factory Studio  after  launching this Studio Overview we have few more section where I can mange our Deployment.


 
Fig 4.0 Panel overview of the Data Pipeline 
	Author: The Author section is where you create and manage your data-related assets.
	Pipeline: This is where you design, configure, and manage data pipelines. Pipelines define the flow of data from source to destination, including any transformations or processing steps.
	Change Data: Change Data Capture (CDC) allows you to track and capture changes in your data sources. It's essential for keeping your data up-to-date and synchronized.
	Dataset: Datasets define the structure and location of your data sources and destinations. They specify how data should be read from or written to various sources.
	Data Flows: Data flows are graphical representations of data transformations. You can use data flows to clean, transform, and enrich your data before it's loaded into a destination.
	Power Query: Power Query is a data transformation and preparation tool. It's used to shape and transform data from various sources before it's used in your pipelines or reports.
	Monitor: The Monitor section provides tools to monitor and manage the execution of your data workflows and pipelines.
	Manage: The Manage section offers options for configuring and managing your Azure Data Factory resources. This includes security, connections, and settings related to your data workflows.



                           SQL Database and Cosmos DB Configuration
Connecting SQL Databases and Cosmos DB:
In This Section We have Connecting Our SQl database and Cosmos Db This step in ensuring the smooth flow of data form its Sources and its destination  
 

	Deploying Azure SQL Server and Cosmos Server

 
	Deploying Azure SQL Server and Cosmos Server
 


In this Section we are follow several step :
 Go to the Manage Section And In this section just link your Services for  upcoming pipeline setup : basically here we are managing our db. connections  for our pipeline setup 

 
 
Configuring Source and Sink :
We have  initiated the setup process by configuring the "Source to Sink" connection. This connection is the bridge that enables data to flow seamlessly from SQL databases to Cosmos DB.

Source Type Configuration: 
In this part we have  configure the connection setup, we carefully configured the source type here we have configure the our SQL server !
Sink Type Configuration : 
In this Part We have configure the  sink connection  for cosmos db. here we carefully  configured the our sink connector  we have configure the our Cosmos Server !
Dataset Addition : 
For each connection, we added datasets that defined the data to be transferred. These datasets included information on tables, queries, and data structures, .

 
After this Connections We have created the New Connection for the Sink in our Data Set 

 

In this 	New Linked Services just fill all your Crucial details 
Data Pipeline Design
Data Pipeline Design: Guideline Your Pipeline Design 
 


In the Data Pipeline Design part first we have go the Author section  In the author section first create Nw folder where I can create all our published  custom pipeline  and in this section we have create a new pipeline

	Organized Custom Pipeline Folders :
 
	Crafting a New Pipeline 
Within the Author section, the option to create a new pipeline  in this our Directory 
 
	General Configuration
In this section  just club our  Configuration  required by the Pipeline Setup . here you can use any custom or complex pipeline .  
 

	Source Definition
In the "Source" section, we defined the source of our data. This could be SQL Server tables, queries, or stored procedures, depending on our data extraction requirements. But in our case, we are gone use to SQL Server.]
 

	Destination Setup
The "Sink" section allowed us to specify the destination for our data. In this case we have use Cosmos Db ( Mongodb) 

	Data Mapping
The "Mapping" section was pivotal in our pipeline design. Here, we mapped the desired columns or results from the source to the destination. This step ensured that data was transformed correctly during the transfer.
 
Settings and User Properties
Finally settings  the user properties in their respective sections enabled us to customize the behavior of our pipeline according to our specific needs.

Customization Opportunities
Azure Data Factory also provided opportunities for advanced customization,  for Data Integration 

Validation and Deployment
Before deploying our pipeline into our Azure environment,  In this section we are validate our pipeline for making free error and  build our pipeline this section 
 
	Seamless Deployment
After validated, our pipeline was ready for deployment. In this section we have deploy  our pipeline into our Azure environment, 
 


                                                       Data Movement Initiatives
 In this section our focus to Managing its Performance and activity and ensuring the reliability 
Pipeline Monitoring : 
In this section we are Monitoring our deployment of pipeline 
 
Alerting Mechanisms: Proactive alerts were configured to notify us of any anomalies or issues during data movement, enabling swift response.
 
Debugging and Issue Resolution
While we aimed for flawless execution, we were prepared to address any unexpected challenges. Our debugging efforts involved:
Logging and Tracing: Comprehensive logs and tracing mechanisms were in place to capture events, errors, and exceptions for thorough analysis.
Error Handling: We implemented robust error handling procedures to gracefully manage exceptions and minimize data disruptions.

                                                         Triggering Automation
In the Trigger Section We have added the Trigger in our pipeline, we harnessed the power of triggers to drive dynamic data updates and ensure our information remained current. This section outlines how we added triggers and deployed them within our pipeline, allowing us reflect changes..
1)	Add The New Trigger 
 
We introduced triggers to our data pipeline to automate data updates at predefined intervals or in response to specific events. With the help of theses trigger data movements and 

 transformations.
2)	Deploy The Trigger Action In Azure Cloud 
 
3)	Published the  Trigger in our Running Pipeline  
 
In the pictorial data, the green zone indicates that our trigger action is functioning correctly. It is actively fetching data from your source database every 2 minutes. 
 

	This means that if you make any changes to your source database, the trigger action will promptly capture and update the data as per the scheduled interval.
